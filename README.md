# react-posenet


Basic react boilerplate for tensorflow js with Posenet

Video shows the problem with several poses and also accuracy is downgrade

This PoC orientates the use of another integration like with Openpose or using 
https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-tfjs-models to simplify development

It's a valid PoC ready to extend and canvas writing is very accurate, allowing interaction with player below it.
