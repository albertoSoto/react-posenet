# react-posenet


Basic react boilerplate for tensorflow js with Posenet & Movenet, showing the difference on the same video

Video shows the problem with several subjects for pose estimation using PoseNet and also accuracy is downgraded
The Poc on main relies on Movenet, kind of cool :). Very good performance.

This PoC orientates the use of another integration like with Openpose or using 
https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-tfjs-models to simplify development

It's a valid PoC ready to extend and canvas writing is very accurate, allowing interaction with player below it.
